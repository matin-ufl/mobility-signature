# Mobility Signature (_paper title_)

All the codes for our data analysis published under _paper title_ is available, except for the feature construction package which is located somewhere else.
***
The packages in this repository can be summarized as follows:

* **Dataset Aggregation:** Merging avaliable data for our participant from different sources.
 * Provided by data collection centers, which are mostly traditional easy-to-access features; i.e., steps per day, minutes of having 1000+ activity count, ...
 * Primary accelerometer features, which contain most of the features in the dataset
 * Features related to locomotion, which is my work and codes (in MATLAB) are available upon request.
* **Dataset examination:**  Checking correlation, VIF, correlation bar plot to the target variable,...
* **Feature Selection and Evaluation:**
 * Applying different feature selection methods (SFS, LASSO, Ridge Regression, ...)
 * Identifying important features (importance factor)
 * Results of different subsets
